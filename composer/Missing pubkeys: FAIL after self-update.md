I found Issue in github : [Link Issue](https://https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/4839)

I asked because I can indeed reproduce your issue on my Linux boxes, but it says:

```shell
# composer self-update --update-keys
Open https://composer.github.io/pubkeys.html to find the latest keys
Enter Dev / Snapshot Public Key (including lines with -----):
```

So I would start at [get public keys](https://composer.github.io/pubkeys.html)
